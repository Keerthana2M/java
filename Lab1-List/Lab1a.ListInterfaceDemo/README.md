2. Adding element at specific index – Insert a new element at a defined position.
3. Adding multiple elements – Add a collection of new elements at once.
4. Accessing elements – Retrieve elements using index.
5. Updating elements– Modify the value at a specific index.
6. Removing elements – Remove items by index or value.
7. Searching elements – Check if an element exists in the list.
8. List size – Get the total number of elements.
9. Iterating over list – Use a for-each loop to traverse.
10. Using Iterator – Use an Iterator to access elements.
11. Sorting – Sort the elements alphabetically.
12. Sublist – Create a sublist from the original list.
